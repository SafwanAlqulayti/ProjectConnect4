# Connect4

It is a game where you have to match a line with the same color in any direction .

# Languages used 
HTML and CSS and for game logic JavaScript .
I have started the game development by crating the game style at the first and then applying the game logic using jQuery .I have used flex boxes  to draw the game circles .

#Winning method 

I have crated a class to each column and row and I have check If they have any of the player colors (Red , Yellow)
the class of the row for example at the start of the game will not have any color and it is length will be 4 
in the middle of the game I have checked if any circle in the row class has any color and start counting the length
when the row is filled the length will be zero and the player will win .

#Favorite function 

the player turn function it can count the turn and decide the class color to add .It saved me a lot of coding .Also Stop clicking in game circle by disabling any css effect it will make the game run on the correct order by disabling other counters from keep counting .

#Unsolved problems 
I think filling the game column could be done using for to check every circle but I could not do it .it will make the code shorter .
